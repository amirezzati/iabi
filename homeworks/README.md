# Project details

All notebooks that I had implemented in this course are listed below.     
You can access them by clicking on their title

## [Classic methods](https://github.com/amirezzati/iabi/blob/main/homeworks/HW1/pract/Classic_HW.ipynb)
In this notebook, I implemented some classic methods in denoising, enhancement, and sharpening the CT-scan images.   

## [Brain MRI classification](https://github.com/amirezzati/iabi/blob/main/homeworks/HW1/pract/Brain_MRI_Classification_HW.ipynb)
In this notebook, I used Pytorch ResNet model to predict which brain MRI image has tumor or not. Subsequently I reported some metrics and visualized feature space with TSNE.

## [Brain MRI Classififcation with AlexNet](https://github.com/amirezzati/iabi/blob/main/homeworks/HW2/pract/Brain_MRI_Classification_with_AlexNet.ipynb)
In this notebook, I implemented AlexNet model from scratch to classify brain MRI images into three different classes. Subsequently I separately trained encoder section with Supervised Contrastive loss and also trained classifier section with Cross Entropy loss.

## [CellProfiler](https://github.com/amirezzati/iabi/tree/main/homeworks/HW3/pract-solution)
In this project, I used CellProfiler tool and implemented a pipeline to automate the process of biological objects analysis.
