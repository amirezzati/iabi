## [Classic methods](https://github.com/amirezzati/iabi/blob/main/homeworks/HW1/pract/Classic_HW.ipynb)
In this notebook, I implemented some classic methods in denoising, enhancement, and sharpening the CT-scan images.   

## [Brain MRI classification](https://github.com/amirezzati/iabi/blob/main/homeworks/HW1/pract/Brain_MRI_Classification_HW.ipynb)
In this notebook, I used Pytorch ResNet model to predict which brain MRI image has tumor or not. Subsequently I reported some metrics and visualized feature space with TSNE.
